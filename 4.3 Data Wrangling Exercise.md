# 4.3 Data Wrangling Exercise

## Submission questions

Create a short document (1-2 pages) in your github describing the data wrangling steps that you undertook to clean your capstone project data set. What kind of cleaning steps did you perform? How did you deal with missing values, if any? Were there outliers, and how did you decide to handle them? This document will eventually become part of your milestone report.

## My response

My approach:

1. Data exploration (and visualization)
2. Data cleaning
3. Data transformation
4. Data analysis

This process has been and is expected to be repeated (iterated) as the data analysis demands.

1. Data exploration

It involved loading the data, checking the data types of different variables, importing packages as necessary. 
As a part of exploration, I played with visualizations like histograms and bar graphs, and displaying them using subplots.

2. Data cleaning

As a part of data exploration, features with missing values ( > 96%) and unknown/missing values have beeb identified. 
Under data cleaning those columns have been eliminated and missing values were replaced with NaN.

3. Data transformation

Columns where replacement/recoding of values were necessary were identified and replaced with new codes.
For example, the column "Readmitted" with values "No", ">30", and "<30" were replaced with "0" for "No" and ">30" and "1" for "<30".

4. Data analysis

So far, a correlation matrix has been created between the continuous variables to identify features that may be eliminated.
