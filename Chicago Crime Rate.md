# Chicago Crime Rate Data
## Background 
Chicago is a city with highest crime rates in the US. City of Chicago has made crime data of Chicago openly available â€“ with crime data ranging from 2001 to present (minus 7 days). The data is a representation of the crime location at a block level, describing the type of crime, the neighborhood of the crime, and other related attributes. 
## Data set
The data has 6.7 million instances and 22 features. The data can be directly seen on the City of Chicago website, click here.
## Goals
The goal of this project is to explore the data, look for correlations between the location of crime and the type of crime, frequency of the crime, classify different crimes, etc. Also, the data can be used to train and test different models. General idea is to predict the crime (or find trends) based on time of the day, location, etc. Fields such as description of the crime are textual, giving us scope to explore into NLP.
## Approach
1.	Understand the features of the database
2.	Data wrangling
3.	Explorative analysis
4.	Predictive analysis, machine learning
5.	Construct models around the data
## Output
1.	Paper
2.	Data analysis with visualizations
3.	Jupyter notebooks
