# Inclusive Images Challenge - Kaggle
## Background 
To make products that cater to all the people around the world, Google AI wants to be able to recognize the region of the world based on images. The challenge is to train a model based on images from certain geographic regions and then iteratively train/test it on images from underrepresented regions in the datasets.
## Data set
The data is a subset of images (pixels), bounding boxes as validation (41.6K images) and test (125K images) sets. It contains 600 object classes and 1.7 million training images. There are also .csv files containing machine and human generated labels for these labels. 
## Goals
The goal of this project is to predict the geographical location based on an image. 
## Approach
1.	Understand the features of the database
2.	Data wrangling
3.	Explorative analysis
4.	Predictive analysis, machine learning
5.	Construct models around the data
## Output
1.	Paper
2.	Data analysis with visualizations
3.	Jupyter notebooks
