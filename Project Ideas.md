#Springboard Capstone Project Ideas

## Project-1: Predicting 30-Day Hospital Readmissions

### Problem
The goal of this project is to predict if a patient would be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of initial discharge. An attempt will be made to make associations/analyze correlations (if any) between the admission type, discharge disposition, demographics and the length of stay. This analysis will be used towards stratifying the risk of patient readmission.

### Data set
The data has been retrieved from the Cerner database, now available in the Machine Learning Repository, it represents clinical data from 1999-2008. The database has over 100,000 diabetes inpatient encounters (diabetes was a diagnosis on these encounters). Information about laboratory tests and the medications that were administered are also available. Further, we have information about the admission type, discharge disposition, and demographic information such as race, age, and gender. Data can be seen [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes%2B130-us%2Bhospitals%2Bfor%2Byears%2B1999-2008).

## Project-2: Inclusive Images Challenge - Kaggle

### Problem
The goal of this project is to predict the geographical location based on an image. To make products that cater to all the people around the world, Google AI wants to be able to recognize the region of the world based on images. The challenge is to train a model based on images from certain geographic regions and then iteratively train/test it on images from underrepresented regions in the datasets.

### Data set
The data is a subset of images (pixels), bounding boxes as validation (41.6K images) and test (125K images) sets. It contains 600 object classes and 1.7 million training images. There are also .csv files containing machine and human generated labels for these labels. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/inclusive-images-challenge#Data-Download-&-Getting-Started).

## Project-3: 

### Problem
Chicago is a city with highest crime rates in the US. City of Chicago has made crime data of Chicago openly available â€“ with crime data ranging from 2001 to present (minus 7 days). The data is a representation of the crime location at a block level, describing the type of crime, the neighborhood of the crime, and other related attributes.

### Data set
The data has 6.7 million instances and 22 features. The data can be directly seen on the City of Chicago website, click [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data).
